# Portolio of Abhinandan Mishra

Abhinandan Mishra is a software engineer, current working as a Specialist Programmer at Infosys. He has good experience of building the solutions for complex problems and has built a bunch of complecated features till date within a short period of his career.

## Features Developed by Abhinandan

### Secret Vaults System
- While working as a full-time software engineer at Cosmocloud, He got multiple challenging opportunities and building the scret vault system was one of them.
- Cosmocloud is a no-code backend platform, where users can build and deploy end to end backend using that platform only, and hence it's very important to provide a feature of adding the secrets of user that they can use in their backend logic but it must be secure as well, so that other's won't be able to access not even anyone in the team.
- Hence, Abhinandan Came up with an approach that only the person with owner's access can add/update/delete the secrets in the platform but no-one can see the value of those secrets even the owners after setting it once.
- Also, the secrets are again encoded with a public key, that is decoded using the private key, that our platform uses. Direct secrets are not stored in comocloud's database making it so secure from everyone.

### Multiple environments feature
- Working on multiple dev-environments become very important when you're working on a mid to big organisation where the feature must be tested well before making it live to production.
- For handling this thing, multiple environments are required by the users to test the codes in those environments without touching the production environment.
- However, there's a feature of rollback to previous deployment but this feature wouldn't cause any panic because "staging" or "development" environments are made for the testing purposes.
- Earlier deployment was directly done on the one environment that is "Production Environment" but now users can create multiple environments and deploy their apis and models on those environments to carry out the testing.
